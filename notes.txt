x SMS your goals for the week, prefaced with 'GOAL:'

x Find or create a user - parse the params[:From] to get the number - if it already exists, attach the goal to that user's goals, if it doesn't create a new one, and attach the new goal

x Add goal model - user has many goals (description, is_active, timestamps)

- Write script to text users their goals for that week - send separate texts for each goal

x use ActiveRecord 

- send person a link of their current and/or all goals (simple html view)

- root url has feed of 100 most recent goals - all public by default?
