- Find or create a user - parse the params[:From] to get the number - if it already exists, attach the goal to that user's goals, if it doesn't create a new one, and attach the new goal

- Add goal model - user has many goals (description, is_active, timestamps)

- Write script to text users their goals for that week - send separate texts for each goal
